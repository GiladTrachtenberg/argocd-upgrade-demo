# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Apply this BEFORE upgrading to v3.0! ⚠️
#
# This ConfigMap adds the fine-grained RBAC permissions required in v3.0.
#
# WHAT CHANGED IN v3.0:
# ====================
# Before v3.0:
#   - Having 'update' permission on Application implied you could update
#     all resources managed by that Application (Deployments, Services, etc.)
#   - Same for 'delete' - deleting an Application implied deleting its resources
#
# After v3.0:
#   - 'update' on Application only lets you update the Application CR itself
#   - 'delete' on Application only lets you delete the Application CR itself
#   - To update/delete MANAGED RESOURCES, you need explicit permissions:
#     - applications, update/*, project/*, allow
#     - applications, delete/*, project/*, allow
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# =================
# If you don't add these permissions, your operators will be able to:
#   ✓ View applications
#   ✓ Sync applications
#   ✓ Trigger resource actions
#   ✗ Update managed resources (e.g., edit a ConfigMap via UI)  <-- BROKEN!
#   ✗ Delete managed resources (e.g., delete a stuck Pod)       <-- BROKEN!
#
# PRODUCTION IMPACT:
# ==================
# In production, our operators need to:
# - Restart pods (requires delete on Pod)
# - Edit ConfigMaps for quick fixes (requires update on ConfigMap)
# - Scale deployments (requires update on Deployment)
#
# Without these new permissions, operators lose these abilities in v3.0!
